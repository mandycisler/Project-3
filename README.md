# Project-3 San Francisco Airbnb Visualization
## Overview and Purpose
This project aimed to tell a compelling story using Airbnb data specifically for San Francisco unveiling the diverse range of accommodations available, from entire homes/apartments, private rooms, and shared rooms. Our analysis delved into key metrics such as daily price, licensed and unlicensed Airbnb accommodations, listings per host, and top hosts.

To achieve this, we leveraged Python, Pandas, and Seaborn for data importation, cleaning, and visualization. Utilizing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) practices, we established a refined CSV format conducive to generating insightful visuals. Our visualizations comprised a range of charts created with Seaborn to effectively communicate our findings.

Moreover, we planned to enhance user engagement through JavaScript-driven interactions. Our primary visualization was an interactive map showcasing the distribution of Airbnb accommodations in San Francisco. Users had the ability to customize their experience by selecting different parameters from menus or dropdowns, thus enriching their exploration of the data.

## Data Source
Authors downloaded the .csv file from: Inside Airbnb. This .csv data files can be found in the Resources folder in main. The dataset includes detailed information regarding San Francisco Airbnb accommodations and includes a variety of details regarding each accommodation. 

## Technologies
* Database: MongoDB to store and extract data from
* Python using Pandas with Jupyter Notebook: To clean the data for the data cleaning function we used to load our data
* HTML / CSS: For the index.html layout and to render our map
* JavaScript: For plotting the interactive map

## Libraries
The following libraries were used in one or more code files:
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* Pprint
* Pymongo
* Seaborn

## Instructions

4. Deploy the map on Github Pages to explore the interactive map.(https://github.com/mandycisler/Project-3/deployments/github-pages)
5. Explore the map by interacting with different parameters, such as all listings and pricing dynamics.
6. Test the functionality and usability of your visualizations and interactive components, and gather feedback for iteration.

## Ethical Considerations
Throughout this project, we prioritized ethical and responsible handling of data, always mindful of respecting users' privacy and confidentiality. We encountered challenges related to missing or ambiguously defined data, requiring us to make careful decisions on how to represent it accurately. Additionally, we reflected on the ethical considerations surrounding Insider Airbnb's security shortcomings, despite its perceived legitimacy on scamadviser.com. Our approach involved acknowledging the limitations and potential biases in our data sources, ensuring transparency and integrity in our analysis and presentation methods.
