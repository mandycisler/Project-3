# Project-3
## Topic and Rationale
This project focuses on utilizing Airbnb data specifically for San Francisco to delve into the diverse range of accommodations available, including entire homes/apartments, private rooms, and shared rooms. Our analysis will encompass key metrics such as the average number of nights booked and the average income generated over the past 12 months.

In addition, we aim to present visual insights by comparing licensed and unlicensed Airbnb accommodations. We may explore the pricing dynamics across various neighborhoods to provide a comprehensive view of the market.

To achieve this, we will leverage Python, Pandas, and Seaborn for data importation, cleaning, and visualization. Utilizing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) practices, we'll establish a refined CSV format conducive to generating insightful visuals. Our visualizations will comprise a range of charts created with Seaborn to effectively communicate our findings.

Moreover, we plan to enhance user engagement through JavaScript-driven interactions. Our primary visualization will be an interactive map showcasing the distribution of Airbnb accommodations in San Francisco. Users will have the ability to customize their experience by selecting different parameters from menus or dropdowns, thus enriching their exploration of the data.
